### *An invisible, unbreakable connection.*

**Akai Ito** (The Red Thread of Fate) is a premium digital sanctuary for couples. Based on the Japanese legend of the invisible red string tied around the little fingers of those destined to be together, this application serves as the modern incarnation of that thread—keeping you connected, no matter the distance.
